🐛 Problem Overview

A malicious script injection (trigger bug) has compromised the database, specifically targeting the
orders table by removing the AUTO_INCREMENT property from the OrderID column. This
prevents the system from generating new Order IDs, causing all order creation attempts to fail with
an "ORDER ID NOT FOUND" error.
